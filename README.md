# ADVANCED-POWER-BI-DASHBOARD-WITH-COMPLEX-DAX-CALCULATION
This project aims to develop an advanced Power BI dashboard leveraging the full capabilities of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for robust data modeling and insightful analytics. The dashboard will be designed to provide comprehensive insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) and facilitate data-driven decision-making for stakeholders.

•	Utilized Power BI's rich visualization options to create dynamic charts, graphs, and maps for intuitive data exploration.

•	Enabled users to drill down into data at various levels of granularity to uncover underlying trends and patterns.

•	Incorporated slicers and filters to allow users to slice and dice the data based on different dimensions and criteria.

•	Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface with clear navigation and tooltips to guide users in exploring the dashboard and understanding the insights presented.
